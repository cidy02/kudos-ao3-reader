# TASKS.md — Kudos task board

Shared, lightweight task board for all AIs + the human. **Read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) first.**
Update this file whenever you start, finish, or hand off work — it is the primary
handoff channel between sessions and between agents.

## How to use it (30 seconds)

- **Claim** a task → move it to **In Progress**; set `Owner`, `Branch`, status `🔄`.
- **Finish** → move it to **Completed** with the commit SHA(s) + date.
- **Hand off / block** → leave it in **In Progress** with `✋ HANDOFF` or `⛔ BLOCKED`
  and a clear **Next step** / **Blocker**.
- Keep entries short; link to `docs/…` or `READIUM_MIGRATION_NOTES.md` for detail.
- Task IDs are `T-NN` (just for cross-reference; pick the next free number).

**Status:** 🔄 in progress · ✋ handoff (ready for pickup) · ⛔ blocked · ✅ done · 🅿️ backlog

## 🅿️ Backlog (prioritized)

### P1 — remaining
- **T-07 · Lazy / on-demand chapter extraction** 🅿️ *deferred.* Legacy/macOS reader
  only (the iOS Readium reader is already lazy); correctness-risky (WKWebView must
  resolve each chapter's CSS/image/font resources). Low ROI — do only if large-work
  perf becomes a real problem. Target: legacy `EPUBDocument.open` upfront-unzip.

### P2 — features & polish (detail in `docs/`)
_None currently._

### Readium migration — `readium-migration` only (see `READIUM_MIGRATION_NOTES.md`)
- **T-20 · Phase-4 interaction polish** — auto-hide chrome on scroll, custom
  page-turn animation, safe-area inset tuning. (Notes ▸ Migration status, Phase 4 = partial.)

### Bugs
- _No active bugs._ ↳ [`docs/Bugs.md`](docs/Bugs.md).

## ✅ Completed (recent — newest first)

| ID | Task | Owner | Branch(es) | SHA (main / readium-migration) | Date |
|----|------|-------|------------|--------------------------------|------|
| T-40 | Continue Reading shelf at the top of the Library (in-progress works, most-recently-read first → one-tap resume into the reader); added `SavedWork.lastReadDate` (FI-17) | Claude | both | _see git log_ | 2026-06-20 |
| T-39 | Settings → About / Sources & Licenses sheet (version, GPL-3.0, SwiftSoup/Readium/ao3_api credits, AO3/OTW disclaimer) (FI-16) | Claude | both | _see git log_ | 2026-06-20 |
| T-38 | Download queue (`DownloadQueue` + root progress banner) — "Download Whole Series" scrapes the series page (`AO3Client.seriesWorks`) and downloads/imports serially via the polite AO3Client; second half of "Download queue / bulk actions" (FI-15) | Claude | both | _see git log_ | 2026-06-20 |
| T-37 | Library bulk-select + bulk actions (delete / save / favorite) via EditMode + `List(selection:)`; first half of "Download queue / bulk actions" (FI-15) | Claude | both | _see git log_ | 2026-06-20 |
| T-36 | Phase-2: native AO3 work Subscriptions (4th "AO3" sub-tab) — reuses worksPage/parseSearchPage; only `li.work.blurb` items surface, so work subs only (FI-14). Completes the Phase-2 read backlog. | Claude | both | _see git log_ | 2026-06-20 |

| T-34 | Phase-2: native AO3 Bookmarks list — generalized the MfL view into `AO3AccountWorksList(kind:)`; `parseBookmarksPage` (`li.bookmark.blurb`, work id from `/works/` link, skips series/external) (FI-12) | Claude | both | _see git log_ | 2026-06-20 |
| T-33 | Phase-2 first authenticated feature: native "Marked for Later" reading list — Bookmarks "Later" segment, authenticated reads via AO3AuthService, reuses parseSearchPage + AO3WorkRow + pagination (FI-11) | Claude | both | _see git log_ | 2026-06-20 |
| T-21 | Calibrate Readium theme colors, typography units, margins, weight, built-in fallbacks, and imported custom-font rendering | Codex | `readium-migration` | — / `6fb3322` | 2026-06-20 |

## 🧭 Key decisions & open questions

- **macOS reader — decided:** iOS/iPadOS use Readium; **macOS keeps the legacy
  reader** (Readium navigator is UIKit-only). Readium SPM is scoped `platformFilter = ios;`.
- **Workflow — decided:** general work on `main` first, then port to
  `readium-migration` (see `AGENTS.md` ▸ golden branch rule).
- **AO3 authentication — decided:** native account UI drives AO3's real form in
  a hidden WebView; mechanism failures reveal the same WebView as a fallback.
  Sessions, never passwords, are stored device-only in Keychain.
- **Open — before going public:** scrub the Apple `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` ID from
  `project.pbxproj`.
- **Open — migration (`READIUM_MIGRATION_NOTES.md` §6):** consolidate Library
  metadata on Readium vs keep the custom OPF layer?
- **Cleanup:** `test/card-lists` is abandoned/polluted and local-only — delete it
  eventually; never merge it.

## ↩️ Context for the next session

- **P0** (lint, error handling, tests) and **P1 #5 / #6 / #8** are **done on both
  branches and pushed**; both branches are in sync with `origin`.
- Natural next pickup: Readium Phase-4 polish (T-20).
- Quick commands — Build: `xcodebuild … CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO` · Test:
  `Scripts/test.sh` · Lint: `Scripts/lint.sh`.
